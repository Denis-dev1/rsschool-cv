### Summary:

Becoming a programmer is what excites me.
This is amazing because you do not stagnate in one place, but gain a lot of experience over time.
Coding is very social, communicating with the team, encountering new issues and solving them in various ways. Is not that great?
So now I'm here to find out what I'm worth.
